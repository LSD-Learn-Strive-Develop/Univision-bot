Hi!

You're here, which means the 2023 Univision has begun! The participants have already performed, and now the outcome of the contest depends on you.

Rules:
You can vote for several participants, but you will NOT have the opportunity to vote for your faculty!

Yes, we understand how you want to support your friends, but let's remember that the most talented applicant will win this way, not the most sociable.

Rather, press the button â€” it's time to make history, and right now the fate of the participants is in your hands!
