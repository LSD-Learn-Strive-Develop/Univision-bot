    You're here, which means the 2025 Univision has begun! The participants have already performed, and now the outcome of the contest depends on you.

    Rules:
    You can vote for several participants, but you will NOT have the opportunity to vote for your faculty!

    Rather, press the button — it's time to make history, and right now the fate of the participants is in your hands!
